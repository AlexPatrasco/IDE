# Submission Process

Laboratory work is considered as successfully passed after fulfilling the following steps:

1. You must elaborate a _Report_ which will contain your work-flow and your conclusions
  - Laboratory work _Report_ submission deadline will be listed on facebook group
  - Laboratory work paper must have at least: 2 pages (3 with title page)
  - All the words and idea should be yours. In most cases I'll differentiate a copy-pasted phrases (even if they will be double-translated using google translate). Don't write essays and poems, just pure technical stuff
2. If asked then you'll have to show your application or ability to solve given tasks/problems
3. Pass the quiz (if there will be any)

As a report template use the one from WP course.

As an email topc ure **[TUM][FAF Labs][WP] Name Surname** template where name is Ion and surname is Ciobanu.

_Note:_

_More details you'll provide in your report, less questions I'll give to you during defense of your report._

_If you don't understand any words used in laboratory works' descriptions then please google them._

_If you don't understand google explanation then try again (and again) or ask for help a colleague or friends._

_If you still don't get something then ask me. Write an email to me or to other teacher. Ask stackoverflow. Do something (!) because you will encounter all these words during your professional carrier. This will help to differentiate you from an average "b√Ædlo-coder"._
