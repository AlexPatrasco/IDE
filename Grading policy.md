# Grading Policy

The idea of grading policy is the same as [WP grading policy](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP/wiki/Grading-Policy). But you start with **2 pt** and you do not gain additional points after mid-term.

You gain points for:

- Doing mandatory tasks **(2 pt)**
- Submitting laboratory work before deadline day **(1 pt)**
- Making additional tasks provided in laboratory work (0-7 pt) number of points will be mentioned for each task

You loose points for:
- Copy-pasting submission paper contents (2 pt)
- Copy-pasting code (2 pt)
- Inability to explain your code or used solutions (up to 3 pt)
- Submission of laboratory work after deadline:
  - max 1 week after (0 pt)
  - max 1 month after (0 pt)
  - more (0 pt)

_If for a laboratory work is due 3rd of March (for example), it means that you should submit it between 00:00:00 03.03.2013 and 23:59:59 03.03.2013 inclusive. One day defore deadline will be between 00:00::00 02.03.2013 and 23:59:59 02.03.2013. All mentions about time and deadline follow the rule of 24 hours time frames._
