# Interactive Development Environments Laboratory Work #2

_Recomended tools are marked with **bold**_

_Use a different IDE for each laboratory work_

## GUI Development
  - **Visual Studio**
  - **Xcode**
  - **QTCreator**
  - Code::Blocks

### Prerequisites:
  - IDEs: (one of) Visual Studio, QTCreator, Code::Blocks, Xcode
  - Languages: C/C++, C#, Python or others (depends on IDE)
  - Technologies and Frameworks: Forms, wxWidgets, Win32 API, WinRT API, PyQt or others (depends on IDE, chosen language and target GUI)

> It is 4102. Aliens invaded us. Luckily the world has some great engineers and you are one of them! Your'e working on an unbeatable weapon: Simulatron. Simulatron is an exact copy of alien ship but it has a secret: when the alien gets into ship the alien is traped and brought into human prison. Your task is very simple: you have to clone Simulatron's control panel. World depends on you...

### Mandatory Tasks:
  - Define 3 virtual tasks that you Simulatron is supposed to control
  - Create a GUI application with 5 standard controls (any child window control mentioned in book Windows Programming ed.5 is considered standard)

### Tasks With Points:
  - Add 3 non-standard controls (2pt)
  - Create a custom control (not existent in IDE) (2pt)
  - Make controls to interact. At least 3 interactions (1pt) _ex. on clicking a button a counter should start_
  - Create a _Reset_ button. On clicking this button all controls should go to their default state (1pt)
  - Add a GUI test (1pt)
  - Add a Unit test. For this you'll need to divide your source code in Controller and View (Business and Presentation layer) (2pt)
  - Set a breakpoint in your application and check variables values at that moment of time (1pt)
  - Set debug watches that will not stop your application from running but will allow you to check any application's state (ex. a variable value at some point of time, if a function was called, memory usage) (1pt)
  - Create an installable application (1pt)
  - Create a cross-platform application (1pt) _available only for some IDEs and languages_
  - Submit your application to [Kivy contest](http://kivy.org/#contest). You may skip mandatory tasks. (5pt)
  - _Mention your own tasks that you did and claim points for them (max of 5 pt in total)_
